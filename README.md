# Fetcher

This is a simple app that fetches items from a web page using an api and displays the result in a list. It
uses the following tools, libraries and architecture:

* Kotlin - Preferred Language

* The New Material Design 3

* Dark Theme Supported

* Jetpack Compose - Declarative UI

* Hilt - For dependency Injection

* Datastore - as data/shared pref for saving theme state

* Testing - a simple unit test was done
 
* Architecture used - Clean Architecture without usecases since it's more of a code duplication in our case here


It was built for the purpose of an assessment aimed at securing a role.
